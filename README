== Harris' Baby Ada Compiler Installation Instructions ==

First you'll need to build the compiler. The compiler uses CMake as a build
system, so you'll need to have that installed. There are no other
dependencies.

[ in the badac root directory ]
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..

If you wish to install to a different location than CMake's default (typically
/usr/local, or some other system-dependent location), you'll want to replace
that last command with

$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/to

CMake will make some preparations and emit an appropriate build script. You
are expected to know what to do with it; on Linux it should be as simple as:

$ make
$ make install

Harris' Baby Ada Compiler is now installed. Refer to doc/manual.pdf for usage
instructions.
